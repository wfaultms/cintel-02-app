# Continuous Intelligence and Interactive Analytics - Initial App

- Interactive app: [cintel-02-app](https://wfault-apps.shinyapps.io/cintel-02-app/)
- Repository: [cintel-02-app](https://github.com/wfaultms/cintel-02-app)
- Author: [Bill Ault](https://github.com/wfaultms)

In this module, we add another important tool: Python. 
If you are new to Python, don't worry, it's relatively easy to learn and very powerful.

ðŸš€ Rocket Tips are for learners who want to go beyond the basics. 
They are not required but can improve workflow, increase productivity, and make things more enjoyable.
